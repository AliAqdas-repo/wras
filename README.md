# Water Reservoir Automation System (WRAS)
Water Reservoir Automation System automatically switches water pump to transfer water from massive underground reservoir to smaller overhead reservoir for daily usage. It senses water levels of both reservoirs using ultrasonic sensors and displays water levels on a LED Bar Graph Display. Alerts are generated on low-levels of water and a beeper is turned on.
## Simulating on your PC
To run these simulations you would be required to install Proteus. It is recommended to install Proteus 8 Professional. Furthermore you would need to install the **Ultrasonic Sensor** library. Files are available in the attached folder.
